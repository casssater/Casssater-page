<h1>Ars Technica Threat Model</h1>
<h2>Who am I, and what amI doing here?</h2>
<p>Where you work, your social and political activities, your notoriety, social connections, travel, and other factors all play into your threat model.</p>
<p><strong>Assets</strong> are the important pieces of information you want to use in an activity but simultaneously want to protect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Credit card data: yours, or (if you sell stuff) a customer's.</li>
  <li>Banking data: account numbers, routing numbers, e-banking usernames and passwords.</li>
  <li>Personally identifying information: Social Security number, date of birth, income data, W-2s, passport numbers, drivers' license or national ID numbers.</li>
  <li>Intellectual property: like that treatment for an Ars action movie I've been working on.</li>
  <li>Sensitive personal or business information and communications: e-mails and texts that could be used to embarrass, blackmail, or imprison you.</li>
  <li>Politically sensitive information or activities that could get you in trouble with your employer, the government, law enforcement, or other interested parties.</li>
  <li>Travel plans that could be used to target you or others for fraud or other forms of attack.</li>
  <li>Other business or personal data that are financially or emotionally essential (family digital photos, for example).</li>
  <li>Your identity itself, if you are trying to stay anonymous online for your protection.</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Who or what might try to mess with me, and how?</h2>
<p>Identifiy possible threats based on motive, resources, and capabilities.</p>
<p>Fucus on the most likely threat to your assets</p>
<p>Accidental disclosure or casual information leakage over email, social media, or other channels can be just as bad as being hacked.</p>
<p>There are six primary types of attacks, as defined by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee823878(v=cs.20)?redirectedfrom=MSDN">STRIDE</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spoofing identity: using some sort of token or credential to pretend to be an authorized user or another piece of trusted software—or, someone posing as someone else in an e-mail or on social media to gain your trust.</li>
  <li>Tampering with data: maliciously altering data to cause a software failure or to cause damage to the victim. This could be to lower the user's trust of the information, or it might be an effort to create an error in software that allows the attacker to launch their own commands on the targeted device.</li>
  <li>Repudiation: the ability to do something (conduct a transaction, change information, access data) without having a record to prove it happened (such as an event log). This is less of an issue for average users and more of a problem for software developers, but it can still be an issue in some fraud attacks.</li>
  <li>Information disclosure: your data gets exposed, either through a breach or accidental public exposure.</li>
  <li>Denial of service: making it impossible for someone to use the application or information, whether it's your personal website or someone trying to boot you off a game network.</li>
  <li>Elevation of privilege: gaining a greater level of access to an application or to data than allowed by altering the restrictions on the user or the application (getting "root," escaping the browser sandbox to install malware, etc.).</li>
</ul>  
<h2>How much can I stand to do about it?</h2>
<strong>Quick Answer:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Back up your stuff to the cloud or a disk drive you detach from your device</li>
  <li>Use a password manager to automate your use of separate passwords for every website</li>
  <li>Update your software whenever alerted to do so</li>
</ul>
<strong>Opsec best practices:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Use a non-jailbroken smart phone or tablet and put a password on it rather than a PIN if possible.</li>
  <li>Put a "security freeze" on your credit report with the three major credit reporting agencies to prevent unauthorized credit applications using your personal data. (It costs about $10 to $15 per agency to set these up.)</li>
  <li>Use specific e-mail accounts for each credit card or banking account—and use "throwaway" e-mail accounts to register on other websites as usernames. Thanks to Web mail, you can have as many e-mail accounts as you want. Having specific accounts for each financial account means that you can safely delete anything coming to other accounts if it appears to be from another bank—such e-mails are probably phishing attacks. This also reduces the threat of someone using an account and password stolen from another site to try to gain access to your more important Web accounts.</li>
  <li>Aggressively use privacy settings on social media to limit who sees posts that could give up information that someone else could use to convince others that they are you.</li>
  <li>When you can't update, mitigate. In some cases, you may just have to completely disconnect older hardware that you can't replace from the Internet and find other means to connect.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rinse and repeat</h2>
<p>Keep going back to your threat model and update what needs updated</p>
